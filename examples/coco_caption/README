This folder is originally from Vsubhashini's Caffe branch (https://github.com/vsubhashini/caffe/tree/recurrent/examples/coco_caption). It mainly holds functions and scripts for image captioning experiments on the COCO dataset. 
The main files and their usage are as follows.
(1) coco_to_hdf5_data.py: preprocess captions to hdf5 data. Including tokenizing, building dictionary, etc.
(2) captioner.py: using beam search or sampling to generate captions.
(3) hdf5_sequence_generator.py: functions to generate hdf5 dataset from sequence data, such as tokenized captions.
(4) hdf5_sequence_generator2.py: modified version of "hdf5_sequence_generator.py". It is used for target data with dimension > 1 on each timestep, such as bbox regression target. 
(5) lrcn.vgg.prototxt, lrcn_solver.vgg.prototxt, train_lrcn.vgg.sh: model structure and training scripts for VGG-LSTM captioning model.
(6) retrieval_experiment_vgg.py: evaluate the captioning model on COCO.
