This folder holds scripts for training and evaluating the faster-rcnn-lstm captioning model. Note that the training/testing framework of this kind of model is different from the other models. It generally follows the faster-rcnn framework, which utilize the Python Wrapper of Caffe to take care of each step in the training and testing: reading data, organizing mini-batches, snapshotting, logging, evaluating. It utilizes a lot of python layers which are located in "lib" folder.
Preprocessing is taken care of by "vg_to_hdf5_data.py" in "models/dense_cap".
The main files and the descriptions are as follows.
  There are three kind of network strucutures:
  (1) faster_rcnn_end2end.sh, train_cap.prototxt, solver.prototxt: training script, network structure, solver for the baseline model. There is no information flow between the two LSTMs.
  (2) faster_rcnn_two_stage_reg.sh, train_cap_two_stage_reg.prototxt, solver_two_stage_reg.prototxt:using bbox regression both at region proposal and final prediction, still no information flow.
  (3) faster_rcnn_cross.sh, train_cap_cross.prototxt, solver_cross.prototxt: model with information flow. In each timestep, the region will be shifted according to the location prediction in the last timestep. The feature pooled from the new region will be feed into the caption LSTM. The hidden feature of the caption LSTM will be feed into the location LSTM.
  Model evaluation:
  (4) test_faster_rcnn_cap.sh: script to test one specific model. It calls the Python script "lib/tools/test_net.py" to do it. For details of the evaluation, please check "lib" folder.
